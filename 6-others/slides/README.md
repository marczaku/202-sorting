# Other Sorting Algorithms
## Heapsort
- O(n log n)
- improves Selectionsort

## Mergesort
- O(n log n)
- like Quicksort, but stable
- but requires O(n) memory

## Timsort / Introsort
- O(n log n)
- version of Quicksort that falls back to other algorithm in bad cases
- fastest known stable/unstable sorting algorithms
