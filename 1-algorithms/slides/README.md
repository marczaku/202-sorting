# 1 Algorithms
An algorithm is a procedure that fulfils a few characteristics:
- **Unambiguous**. Each of its steps should be clear and each input should have one expected output.
- **Input**. Can be 0 or more.
- **Output**. Can be 1 or more.
- **Finiteness**. It should run forever.
- **Feasibility**. It should work with given resources.
- **Independent**. The steps are independent of any programming code.

Since Algorithms always return something, we say that it solves a problem.

And the problem can often be of variable size.

## Samples:
- Search, Sort, Insert, Update, Delete

You will see that most algorithmic problems can be reduced to one of these, actually.
